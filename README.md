doTA, doT for Angular
=================

Experimental Micro Templating engine inspired from doT.

doTA is not actually [doT](https://github.com/olado/doT), but produce similar function that generate template like doT does.

---

This project has two libraries, doTA, and ngDoTA.

### doTA
- no dependencies
- can run on both server and client
- parse html from string and convert them into javascript function, which use to render with data (any objects)
- checkout this jsperf for quick look ([doT vs doTA vs Handlebar](http://jsperf.com/dot-dota-handlebar))

### ngDoTA
- included doTA
- included angular directive called render
- accept templateName or inline and render html with doTA by binding to $scope and $filter, without involving $digest cycle (0 watchers), unless you explicitly set compile or watch options

##### Checkout [examples](http://rawgit.com/S-YOU/doTA/master/examples/index.html) from github, which is based on various online benchmarks or blogs.

### Some limitations on HTML Parser

 - must be valid html
 - must be used html entities to attributes, NO `<, >, &`
 - usage of `'` or `"` or `\` in text nodes or inside attributes may work or may not works.
 - you need dedicated control on html, shouldn't be used on user-defined templates or security will suffer.
 - don't use single plus + character between two interpolation like `{{x}}+{{y}}`, use %20 if it is in URL.

### Supported Angular or similar syntax

- loop
	- `ng-repeat="x in data"` - array
		- `ng-repeat="x in data | filter:y | orderBy:x"` - filters inside ng-repeat
		- `$index` - can be used on attributes
			- to bind like `ng-model="data[$index]"`, normal `ng-model="x"` won't work
	- `ng-repeat="k,v in data"` - dict (angular syntax (k,v) in data)
	- `ng-repeat="i in 1:10:2"` - range

- conditionals
	- `ng-if="expression"` - (must be valid javascript expression)
		- extra `elif` and `else` support (use with strip=1, must follow by previous `ng-if` or `elif` - no middle text nodes allowed)
	- `ng-class="{a:x>y,b:z}"` - (must be valid javascript object)
	- `ng-show` - when false, add `ng-hide` class
	- `ng-hide` - when true, add `ng-hide` class

- interpolations
	- `{{ ... }}` - interpolations
	- `{{ ... | filter1:x:y | filter2:a }}` - filters inside interpolations

- ng-events
	- enabled by default
		- can be disabled by using event=0 on render directive
		- supported `change click dblclick mousedown mouseup mouseover mouseout mousemove mouseenter mouseleave keydown keyup keypress submit focus blur copy cut paste`, but untested
		- all the events and its expressions are lazy. angular won't involve until event fired.
		- change event may be different behavior with angular, untested

- ng-init
	- `ng-init="expression"` - evaluate the expression as javascript

- ng-controller
	- `ng-controller="ctrl"` - should be same behavior as angular
		- will create new scope with `scope.$new()`
		- may be used `"ctrl as vm"` or `controller-as="vm"` - untested

- some ng-xx aliases
	- `ng-value="value"` - set to `value` attribute without interpolation. $filters can be used
	- `ng-src="{{base}}/image/{{size}}.jpg"` - expand interpolation and set `src` attribute
	- `ng-alt` - expand interpolation and set `alt` attribute
	- `ng-title` - expand interpolation and set `title` attribute
	- `ng-href` - expand interpolation and set `href` attribute
	- `ng-style="height:{{height}}px"` - expand interpolation and set/merge `style` attribute
		- this is basically for IE/Edge, but does not accept objects like angular does

- ng-model
	- experimental, disabled by default
	- enabled by using `model=1` on render directive
	- `ng-model="scope_var"` - only accept dot notation or without, does not use angular $parse
		- one `$watchCollection` will be added

- ng-bind
	- experimental, disabled by default
	- enabled by using `bind=1` on render directive
	- `ng-bind="scope_var"` - apply scope_var to `textContent` or `innerText`
		- one `$watchCollection` will be added

---

### render directive attributes

- inline
	- get template string from `innerHTML` instead of from template
	- this will ignore if template is once compiled

- cache-dom
	- before `$scope` is destroyed, relocate DOM to safer place, and reuse it as is when same directive is called again.
	- for static DOM, no dynamic binding.
	- specify `2` to run `onLoad` expressions

- onload
	- evalulate javascript when done, `this` is bind to current DOM

- ng-load
	- evaluate `$scope` function when done, with `$event` object injectable like angular

- compile
	- use angular `$compile` on nodes with `dota-pass` or its children

- compile-all
	- use angular `$compile` with `elem.contents()` - not much performance gain from doTA with this option.

- encode
	- use when attributes contain `<`, `>`, `&` characters, or may get into infinite loop or will throw errors.
	- when using with jade templates, I never need this.

- loose
	- set by default - `undefined`, `0`, `false` will be blank
	- use `loose=0` if you don't want `0` as blank

- strip
	- strip whitespaces before and after tags, disabled by default

- scope
	- will create new scope with `$scope.$new()`
	- having `ng-controller` on render directive will have new scope too, but only one.

- watch
	- will add `$watchCollection` and will re-render the the whole template when watch triggered.

- watch-diff
	- will add `$watchCollection` and will partially patch DOM, when changed
	- only attributes or first text node changes allowed
	- known issue: `<`, `>` will display as `&lt;` and `&gt;` in text nodes

- diff-level
	- will use experimental **FlatDOM**, which diff html as text and incrementally patch DOM while parsing
	- `diff-level=2` - ng-if that evaluated to false render as hidden placeholders, replace/patch DOM elements when changed.
	- `diff-level=3` - no placeholders, add/remove/patch DOM elements when changed.
	- `diff-level=0` - generate function same as other diff-level, but patching DOM function excluded, for partial templates.
	- known issues: `&lt;`, `&gt;` will display as is in text nodes

- key
	- `key=K` - any keyname to be used in diff-level loop inner variables, for partial template pre-compile.

- event
	- set by default
	- convert ng-events into de-events - which is DOM events, that evalutes $scope function when triggered.

- model
	- experimental
	- convert ng-model into internal approach,
		- which bind `input` event on text box and `change` event on others input, checkbox, radio, select
		- update to model value when data changed
		- events are throttle with 200ms by default, you can set with `throttle` attribute
		- just one way binding of input back to model, that's all
	- no validations, no other features from ng-model

- bind
	- experimental
	- convert ng-bind to internal approach,
		- which set `textContent` or `innerText` when data change
		- just one way binding of data into view

- ng-model
	- experimental
	- ng-model on render tag will make render attribute removed and $compile with angular instead

- loaded
	- once loaded, this attribute will be set to `true`
	- may be useful for hiding raw tags before angular render, with custom CSS (not included)

			```css
			[render][loaded=false] {
				display:none;
			}
			```

- optimize
	- additional optimization on output
		- currently only size optimization, which strip unnecessary quotes on attributes
			- may be only useful for pre-compiled templates on server side

- data-XX
	- all `data-XX` attributes on directive will be available as `$attr.XX` on templates

- scope-XX
	- all `scope-XX` attributes on directive will be available as `$attr.XX` on templates
	- attr without `.` or `[` will be `$scope[attr]` or it will `$scope.$eval`

- attributes startswith '-' will treat as property
	- `-scroll-left=expr` - primitive or scope property can be used, no interpolations.

- debug
	- some debugging output - also need to use with non-minified version of doTA.js or ngDoTA.js

### limitations on render directive

- data must be available before directive called.
- if data is not ready, you need to wrap `render` directive with `ng-if="data"`
- `ng-repeat="item in data"` is transformed into javascript loop, so internal variable like `item` is not available to angular, use `data[$index]` to get access to them. Normally to use with `ng-model="data[$index]"`

---

### doTA - attributes inside HTML templates

- dota-pass
	- will skip parsing `ng-*` attributes
	- interpolations with `{{ ... }}` will still be expanded, or use `ng-bind` without `bind=1` option

- dota-continue
	- will continue parsing `ng-*` attributes, when inside `dota-pass`

- watch - `watch="expression"`
	- will create sub functions, and will add watch or one-time watch with `::`
	- will re-render when watch triggers

### extra directives

- dota-include - like `ng-include="tpl/name"` but usign doTA - static
- dota-template - like `ng-include src="tpl/name"` - dynamic - one `$watcher`
- dota-http - a service which return compiled template as string

---

### Usage:

- Module

	```javascript
	angular.module('yourApp', ['doTA']);
	```

- Provider

	```javascript
	myapp.controller('myctrl', ['$scope', 'doTA', function($scope, doTA){
		...
	}])
	```

- Template
	```html
	<div render='path/to/tpl.html'></div>
	```

- Inline
	```html
	<div render='something_unique' inline=1>
		<div>some more html</div>
	</div>
	```

- ng-repeat example
	```html
	<div ng-controller="mycontroller">
			<div ng-if="data">
				<table render=1 inline=1>
					<tr ng-repeat="line in data">
						<td>{{line[0]}}</td>
						<td>{{line[1]}}</td>
						<td>{{line[2]}}</td>
						<td>{{line[3]}}</td>
						<td>{{line[4]}}</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			</div>
	</div>
	```

- watch example
	```html
	<div ng-controller="mycontroller">
		<table render=1 inline=1 watch="data">
			<tr ng-repeat="line in data">
			....
	```

I have downloaded each plunks and tested on Chrome Timeline JS Profiler

- Pure Angular - http://imgur.com/TXi5Ky3 - 1.08s
- Angular + ReactJs - http://imgur.com/2lO8Frb - 465ms
- doTA - http://imgur.com/JxBxO7C - 164ms
- doTA (with watch) - http://imgur.com/IyotTaL - 166ms initial
(I have tried 15 times refresh data button, its 165ms to 265ms, sometimes GC got triggered and used like 80ms)
- doTA (with watch, compile=1, dota-pass and ng-binding/ng-model) - 172ms, not much difference as above.
(but with compile-all=1, its 365ms, since it pass the whole html to angular to $compile)
